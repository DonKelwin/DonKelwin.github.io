# Keyholder Prototype

## Overview

The main function of this prototype is to reveal a secret (e.g. passwords) to the relatives of a deceased person.
It is designed to function only when three specific keys are inserted into their respective slots. 
It serves as a access control mechanism, where the correct placement of all keys enables the system to operate. 
This document provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up, using the prototype, and outlines its main features.

## Features

- **3-Key Access System**: Only functions when all three keys are properly inserted.
- **Visual Feedback**: Indicator lights that show the status of the box.
- **Security Control**: Unauthorized access is prevented unless all keys are in place.
- **No key inside**: There are no secrets inside the box. The secret is received by typing a sequence on an external website
- **Stylish**: Keys have durable aesthetics and must be manipulated before placing them into the box

## Requirements

To get started, you will need the following:

- [ ] Main box
- [ ] The 3 keys
- [ ] Power source for the main box (e.g. power outlet, battery) with at least 5V
- [ ] The website where you have to input the sequence [https://donkelwin.github.io/PSWH.html] 
- [ ] Placement order of the keys (as part of the multi-factor-authentication)
- [ ] (Sun)Light, more preferably a UV flashlight

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Hadware**
   -  Turn off the lights in the room and darken the room completely if possible.
   -  Light up the bottom of the keys with the UV flashlight and keep it turned on as the glow-in-the-dark filament needs to charge (at least 2 min).
   -  Open up the website

2. **Activate the System**
   -  Ensure that the box is connected to a power supply.
   -  The lights of the box turn on and a little intro is being played once it has power (keep charging the filament during this time)
   -  After 30s the box is ready.

3. **Insert Keys**
   -  Insert all three keys into their respective slots. Put all three keys simultaneously and instantly into the key slots after you removed them from the UV light cone.
   -  Check the visual indicators to ensure each key is recognized correctly.
   -  Be mindful that you may have to to reseat the key as it may not contact the pin inside the box properly. In case of reseating, check the emitting glow from the bottom of the key. You might need to recharge the filament (of all keys) again aswell.
  
4. **Wait for Verification**
   -  If correctly seated, the box automatically recognizes the keys and checks them for correctness
   -  If the keys are in the correct slot and the emitting light has the correct value the lightring in the middle blinks green.
   -  It starts to slowly show a sequence. Copy this sequence to the website and receive your secret.

## Troubleshooting

- **Key Not Recognized**: Ensure that the key is properly inserted and aligned to the inner pin.
- **Correct slots for the keys but still no verification**: Make sure that you put all 3 keys at the same time and instantly into the correct slot. The emitting light is fading rapidly so make sure that you are quick to react.
- **It does not power up**: Check the power source and make sure you have at least 5V.
- **Website does not reveal the secret**: Make sure that you copy the correct sequence to the website. The light ring is slightly off in rotation.
